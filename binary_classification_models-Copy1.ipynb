    "This notebook uses a wide variety of modeling algorithms for a binary classification problem. It reads a file created from a feature selection process that has a reasonably small number of good variables, and we know their order of multivariate importance because we used a proper wrapper method. We can explore # input variables, model algorithms and tune model hyperparameters. At the end we can select our favorite algorithm, run it again and build the final model performace score percentile tables.\n",

    "Here we call the larger fraction population the goods and the smaller fraction the bads. This notebook was originally written for fraud detection but can be used for any binary classification. It uses detection rate as an appropriate measure of model goodness.\n",

    "Rather than use a built-in CV, we do a \"manual CV\" by running each model multiple (nitermax) times and average the performance on the training (trn), testing (tst) and validation (val) data sets.\n",

    "Some of the ML algorithms are very fast and some are slow. Feel free to comment out any cells/models you want. At the bottom of the notebook you should select your final/best model and hyperparameters to run one time only and then make the business performance tables for that final model. Note once we've decided on the final model and hyperparameters we're allowed to make several trial runs of our final model train looking for a good performance on the testing data, as long as we don't make any changes to the model hyperparameters from our final choice."
